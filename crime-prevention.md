## Deterring Burglars

The days are getting shorter and daylight will soon start to fade at around 4pm. If you are returning home after dusk please remember to set timer switches to turn on lamps to make your home look occupied. If you are going out when it is dark, leave lights on as you would if you were home.

### Home security

It takes just a moment for a thief to reach through an open window, or walk through an open door, and grab your property. If you're going out, or even if you're just leaving the room - shut and lock external doors and windows. Keep valuables out of sight of doors and windows.

### Jewellery
With the price of gold going up, thieves are on the look out for your jewellery and are known to snatch gold chains from the wearer. Summer clothes mean your jewellery is more likely to be seen, so consider carefully where, when and whether you wear it.

### Mobile phones and other mobile devices
Be aware of your surroundings if you have to use your phone when you're out on the street. It's easy to get involved in a conversation, a text or even just daydreaming, and your phone could be snatched before you even know that someone was eyeing it up.

Make sure you record the IMEI number of your phone. Install and activate a location finding app, and register your mobile devices on www.immobilise.com. Police regularly return property to it's rightful owner and arrest people in relation to theft thanks to these simple measures.

### In cafes, restaurants, pubs, parks and while shopping
Coats, bags and buggies can be heavy and cumbersome at the best of times, but when it's hot and you're chilling out or shopping, it's tempting to leave them unattended or out of sight for a while. Please keep valuable property zipped up in a pocket close to you. It doesn't take long for someone to dip into an open or unattended bag or push chair and make off with your wallet and phone.

Police are out on patrol in plain clothes and in uniform, looking to catch, deter and disrupt offenders. Officers also work closely with Haringey Council CCTV operators to tackle theft.

We ask for your assistance, as a few simple preventative steps could save you the heartache, hassle and expense of losing your valued personal possessions.

## Pickpockets

Please see advice from the British Transport Police on how to avoid being pickpocketed. Watch these short [videos](http://www.btp.police.uk/pickpockets/) for the ‘Tricks of Pickpockets’ and the tell-tale signs:
Keeping the Burglar Out!

Most burglaries tend to be opportunistic rather than planned. If your home does not look secure, seems unlived in, or provides unobserved access, it could be at risk. Understanding what burglars look for when choosing their target will help you identify weak spots in your home's security. Our top ten tips are:

1. Mark or etch your property with your postcode;
2. Register items with a serial number at: www.immobilise.com
3. Do not leave car keys or ID documents near doors, letterbox or windows;
4. Always check who’s at the door and don’t open it if you feel anxious;
5. Close and lock all doors and windows, even if you are only going out for a few minutes;
6. Keep valuables out of sight;
7. Leave some lights on if it will be dark before you arrive home;
8. Install a visible burglar alarm;
9. Always keep sheds and outbuildings locked;
10. Cancel milk or other deliveries if you will be away for days or weeks at a time.

Burglary, on the whole, is an opportunist crime. A burglar will select a target because it offers the best opportunity to carry out a crime undetected and with the fewest obstacles. A building that presents itself as unoccupied and insecure is more likely to be targeted than one that is properly secured. Some features that make you more vulnerable include: side gates open; accessible windows open; ladders left out (allowing access to otherwise inaccessible windows); garden tools available to force entry; untrimmed hedges or high fences preventing natural surveillance. Residents of multi occupancy dwellings or flats should be mindful not to grant entry to people via an entry phone system if they do not know them and to be cautious of people seeking to 'tailgate' them into buildings. Milk bottles or parcels on the doorstep; newspapers and mail in the letterbox; unlit houses after dark; are all signs telling the burglar disturbance whilst breaking-in is unlikely. Naturally, circumstances may arise when such situations are unavoidable. If we take measures that tell the burglar this building is too difficult or too risky a target, he or she will hopefully move on.

## Beware of Pickpockets

The Muswell Hill Festival was in Cherry Tree Wood again last year on Sunday afternoon 9 September, 2012. The event is a fund raiser for the local charity for Children with Cerebral Palsy.

If you are attending any event which may well be crowded, beware of pickpockets and jewelry snatchers. As the price of most metals has risen, especially gold and silver, the police have informed us that there has been a marked increase in the number of high value items being grabbed. The advice given is, leave precious items at home and do not carry an excess of money.

Security Advice.

### Going Away

If you are going away at all, please remember to set timer switches to turn on lights within your property, lock windows, and make sure you engage a mortice lock on front and rear doors.

### Home Security information

An insight into what deters burglars from targeting a property was given by a prolific burglar who was recently jailed for 5 years after admitting 25 counts of burglary.

In a letter he wrote that he would not select a property with any of the following:
- A well lit premises
- The presence of a dog
- Anti-climbing paint on drainpipes, balconies etc.
- Barrier fencing above garden gates and perimeter walls
- Motion sensor lighting
- Beware of dog stickers
- Alarm warning stickers
- Pebbles/shingle near rear patio doors
- CCTV camera (dummy or live)
- Pad sensors behind doors/windows
- 'Switch house alarms on'

In the lead up to Christmas it is more than ever the time to ensure your property is secure from the risks of burglary and your property is properly protected.

Gaming consoles (XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo)

On line gaming consoles are one of the most popular Christmas gifts for children and adults, and are becoming one of the most sort-after items in domestic burglaries. Steps can be taken to secure your property and to assist in recovering items should they be stolen.

1. Register your item with the guarantor on the day of purchase.
2. Immediately take a note of the serial number.
3. Keep a log of all tags used on your console.
4. Mark your product using approved property marking system such as Selectamark, Selecta DNA or Smart water. Also mark your system with your house number and postcode using an Ultra Violet marker pen which is available from the Neighbourhood Watch office.
5. Register your item at www.immobilise.com along with any other valuables you may have.
6. Keep your console out of view from windows when you’re not at home.
7. If stolen; check on eBay, gum tree, craigslist, cash converters, local second hand shops, markets and boot sales. If your item is seen, contact police immediately on our non emergency number, 101.

It is also good practice to discuss the uniqueness of your console with friends in your circle of gaming. This will assist for them to help recognise your console should it be stolen.

### Important points

Gamers may notice when a known tag user changes tact or behaviour or whether they are playing different games etc. Report all suspicious activities to Police.

The hard drives on gaming machines hold credit card details as well as previously used tags. It’s in the interest of parents to make sure consoles are registered and secured etc.

Please note that the Neighbourhood Watch office will be closed from 16th December until 3rd January. During this period your Safer Neighbourhoods Teams will look after any Neighbourhood Watch enquiries. Contact details for Safer Neighbourhoods Teams can be found at www.met.police.uk/haringey.

The 101 non emergency number is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including Christmas and the New Year for non-emergency report and advice.

## Further Crime Prevention Advice.

Weather can be a decisive factor in the day-to-day life of a criminal; on miserable, cold and wet days more people will stay home and shut their doors and windows, making it less easy for the opportunist burglar. Come the sunshine caution is thrown to the wind and doors and windows are left open to let in the fresh air and the burglars. Sunshine brings a change in people’s attitude and moods, people are happier, more trusting, and more likely to enter into conversations with complete strangers, resulting in criminals taking advantage of people’s happier nature, to execute their criminal activities and scams. Statistics show that sunshine can contribute to an increase in burglaries by up to 40%.

There are many budding 'entrepreneurs' out there who come up with very good ways to make tax free money, one of these being door to door collections for donations to charity or sponsorship for local events and schools. The forms they present are well thought out, professional and very believable. Do not hand over cash to these people, no worthy cause will benefit from these illegal collectors.

Please can I ask Coordinators to remind your members of the importance of not leaving ground floor windows open, even if you are at home. It only takes a burglar a few seconds to get into your home and steal your belongings whilst you have popped into another room. One of our members in the Bruce Grove Ward has been a victim of such a crime and I am informed by Anna, the Watch Coordinator that this not the first incident. Although this happened on Bruce Grove Ward, these opportunist burglars could just be passing by your home! If you see anyone acting suspiciously please dial 999.

### WINDOW LOCKS AND FITTINGS (24/4/2008).

Sash Windows: Fit two sash stops, one flush with the window and one no more than 130mm (5”) up. This will enable you to lock it in an open position for ventilation.
Examples of this type of lock are- Chubb WS1 Window lock, Ingersoll SW66 or ERA 822.

Wooden or Metal Casement or Fanlight Windows: Fit two clenching staple locks to large casements and one to smaller fanlight windows. These locks cannot be locked in an open position so it is important to make sure that they are engaged and fully locked before you leave your home. Examples of this type of lock are- Chubb 8K101, Yale P113 or ERA 810 for wooden windows. Chubb 8K106, or Yale p113M for metal windows.

UPVC, PVCU or PVC Windows: Check with the manufacturer before fitting any locks onto these types of window as you may invalidate any warranty. Locks are available for these types of window. Examples are- Chubb 8K123 or ERA 810.

Louvre Windows: There are no locks that can be fitted to this type of window. It is recommended that you remove each pane of glass, clean and superglue them back into the metal frames, and then tighten retaining screws.

Most of these locks are available from locksmiths and DIY stores and can be fitted by a competent DIY enthusiast.

Burglars are at their most vulnerable when they can be seen forcing their way into houses or flats. Locks increase the time they have to spend outside your home and the likelihood of discovery. They will always go for the easy option, which is either an open window or a window without locks.
