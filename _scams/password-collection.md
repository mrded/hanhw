- Beware of e-mails possibly even appearing to be from friends, suggesting things such as watching a video.
- It is important to see if the link really points to a trustworthy site likely to have videos to watch and not to a signup with a completely different site.
- The text that you see in a link in an e-mail message or Internet page is no reliable indication of where the link really points.
- It is important to set the status bar of your e-mail program or your browser to On.
- With Outlook Express or Internet Explorer, for example, you can click View and then make sure Status Bar is ticked and if not, tick it by left clicking the phrase "Status Bar".
- The Status Bar at the bottom of the page window will show where the link really points.
- Even then it is no guarantee that a page is really from where you think it is!
- It is also worth right clicking the sender's name and then left-clicking Properties to see if the e-mail is from your Contact's usual e-mail address! Even if it is, the e-mail may not be from the address shown!
- Do not rely on assuming that if you see a friend's name in the From field of the e-mail, that the message is really from them!
- Even if this seems to show who the e-mail is from, it can not be relied on.
- If you join such a site you may be asked to allow them to e-mail everyone in your address list.
- If you have an address book on a webmail account they may ask for the password! Some people actually give their e-mail passwords to such sites!
- If you have done so, you must change your password as soon as possible.
