title: Dangerous Fake Digital Thermometers from the Internet 
---
Investigators from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have seized over 400 fake digital thermometers after raids in Harrow and Oxford as part of a UK-wide operation to prevent unapproved medical devices being sold over the internet.

Some of these fake thermometers were being sold cheaply online for 99p and they do not have appropriate CE safety markings, warnings or instructions for use to prevent them endangering people’s health. They are likely to give inaccurate readings, posing a serious threat to the health of adults and small children who have potentially killer illnesses such as meningitis.

The MHRA launched the raids after the parents of a young child with leukaemia used a fake thermometer bought online and realised it was giving a misleading temperature reading. Their child had a high temperature and was rushed to hospital to receive urgent medical care despite the fake thermometer showing that their child did not have a high temperature. The fake thermometers have no recognised brand name and can be recognised by missing information on the packaging:

- No instructions for use leaflet is with the product.
- No lot or batch identification number is listed.
- No CE mark is affixed.
- No manufacturer or European representative details are listed.
- No four digit identification number to show that the device has been through the appropriate safety assessment.

During the UK-wide operation, the MHRA also seized a number of other fake medical devices from other locations around the UK such as seven Kiddicare cool pads that should help reduce children’s temperatures and three counterfeit Slendertone devices – used to tone people’s stomach muscles.

These products have been sold on Ebay below the market value and the MHRA is working with Ebay to prevent unapproved devices being sold. The MHRA is currently involved an ongoing investigation into how these products were supplied onto the UK market.

Dr Hilary Jones, television doctor, said:

> “High temperatures in children can be a sign of serious illness and these raids by the MHRA show why it is so important that people are aware that fake thermometers and other fake medical equipment are being sold cheaply on the internet.

Dr Nicola Lennard, the MHRA’s deputy clinical director, said:

> “Inaccurate readings from cheap, fake thermometers could result in a delay to a child getting the medical treatment they need and it is vital that people do not buy or use cheap, unapproved medical devices.

The public are urged to report faulty medical devices to an Incident Hotline on 020 3080 6080 or via the website, http://www.mhra.gov.uk.”
Editorial note.

Boots market a thermometer that looks very similar, however it is marked "Boots" and CE on the case.
