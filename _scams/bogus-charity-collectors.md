title: Bogus Charity Collectors

Police are warning residents to be aware of bogus charity collectors after Safer Neighbourhoods officers stopped two boys going door to door in Crouch End claiming to be collecting for 'Children in Need'.

On Monday 19th April at about 1.50pm Sergeant Leon Christodoulou and PC Steve Humphrey from Highgate Safer Neighbourhoods team were on their way from the Safer Neighbourhoods base in Crouch End to patrol in Highgate ward when they saw two boys (an 18 year-old and a 17 year-old) going door to door in Bedford Road N8. The officers stopped the two boys and, following enquiries, established that they had been calling at residents homes with an official sponsorship form claiming to be collecting money for a charity run in aid of ‘Children in Need’.

The boys were arrested on suspicion of fraud and about £17 was seized. The boys subsequently made a full admission to having collected the money fraudulently. The 17 year-old was reprimanded and the 18 year-old was cautioned for fraud by false representation.

Highgate Safer Neighbourhoods team Sergeant Leon Christodoulou said:
>"Bogus charity collectors prey on people’s goodwill. We advise residents not to open the door to strangers. However if you do get approached by someone claiming to collect for charity, ask to see their licence. If you have any concerns about the authenticity of the individual, call the police. To find out how best to contribute safely and officially contact the charity directly.”

A BBC spokesperson for 'Children in Need’ said: “We advise our supporters not to collect money in the street or any other public place without a licence from their local authority. If the public are unsure about a collection happening in their area, we would recommend that they ask to see a collection licence and contact the police if they suspect the activity is fraudulent.” People can donate to Children In Need securely online at bbc.co.uk/pudsey or via the phone 03457 33 22 33 .

All charities have to be registered with the Charities Commission. You can easily check if a charity is registered with them by going to their web-site, http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/
